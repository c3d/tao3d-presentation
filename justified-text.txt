Tao3D has a real-time text layout engine for text boxes. That layout engine is designed to be fast enough to layout relatively large amounts of text in real-time (or at least fast enough for interactivity).

Despite being real-time, this layout engine is quite powerful, being able to do both horizontal and vertical layout, centering, justification, last-line justification, or spread between word and character spacing.

You can use the various justification controls to get exactly the layout you need for optimal rendering of the information you want to share.
